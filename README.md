##Mmo Rock Paper Scissors

The classic game Rock Paper Scissors using sessions (cookies) to send
the score through the different request.

Also is using a key to encrypt the data in the cookie.

This is not a secure way to encrypt the data because the key is right in the
server.rb file :) just an example on how to use sessions, cookies and the
encryption methods.
